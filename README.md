# Installation

## Installation Guide for Neo4j on Windows 11

Note that for neo4j 4.4.32, java 11 is needed.
For neo4j 5.26.8, java 17 is needed.
<details>
<summary>Step 1: Install Java</summary>

1. Download and install JRE from [Open Logic official website](https://www.openlogic.com/openjdk-downloads).  
   <span style="color:gray">JDK and JRE have differences. JDK (Java Development Kit) includes the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) and Java development tools. On the other hand, JRE (Java Runtime Environment) is the environment required to run Java programs. If you only want to run Java programs, you only need to install the JRE. However, if you wish to develop Java programs, you must install the JDK.</span>
   - Select the version needed for Neo4j. We use JAVA 11. Select to download the msi file.  
     ![open_logic.png](images/open_logic.png)
      1. Open the downloaded .msi file.
      2. Install JRE following the instructions and keep notes of your installation path.

2. Set up the Java environment path.
   - Search `environment` on the start menu.  
     ![img.png](images/start_menu_search.png)
   - Click "Environment Variables".

     ![img.png](images/neo4j_path.png)

4. Start Neo4j program.
   - Start a command prompt window.  
     ![img.png](images/prompt_window_neo4j.png)
   - Change the directory to the Neo4j directory, then change the directory to `bin`.  
     ![img_1.png](images/prompt_neo4j_console.png)
   - Input `neo4j console`.

<summary>Step 3: Install Github Desktop</summary>


1. download the application from the [github desktop official site](https://desktop.github.com/).<br>
2. sign in your Github Desktop.<br>
3. clone the project.<br>

</details>
<details>
<summary>Step 4: Setting up Python Environment</summary>

1. download and install anaconda.
    - Go to the [Anaconda Distribution page](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution).
    - Choose the appropriate version for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux) and download the installer.
    - Install Anaconda:
        - **Windows:**
            - Run the downloaded .exe installer.
            - Follow the instructions in the setup wizard. It‚Äôs generally recommended to install for "Just Me" and to add Anaconda to your PATH environment variable.

2. create environment.
    - Open Anaconda Prompt (Windows).
    - Create a new environment:
      ```sh
      conda create --name ex_per_per_tea python=3.11
      ```
      `ex_per_per_tea` is our desired environment name and `3.11` with the Python version we need.

3. activate environment.
    - **Windows:**
      ```sh
      conda activate ex_per_per_tea
      ```
 
4. install requirement.txt.
    - Change directory to the folder where you saved this project. You probably need to set up a proxy if you are using a company network.
     - Install the packages listed in `requirements.txt`:
      ```sh
      pip install -r requirements.txt
      ```
</details>





# Running the Application
1. **Start neo4j**
    - Repeat the steps to access "Start Neo4j program" from Installation, Install Neo4j.
2. **Run the Python Application**:
    - Navigate to the directory containing `app.py`.
    - Run the application using the following command:
      ```bash
      python app.py
      ```

# Neo4j Database Structure
## Node Types:
- `Content`: Represents different types of content in the database.
- `KnowledgeTreeEle`: Nodes in the knowledge tree.
- `PeopleNode`: Nodes representing people who review content.
- `Review`: Represents reviews for each content.

## Relationships:
- `(:KnowledgeTreeEle)-[:HAS_CONTENT]->(:Content)`: Indicates that a node in the knowledge tree has associated content.
- `(:Content)-[:HAS_REVIEW]->(:Review)`: Content nodes have reviews associated with them.
- `(:Review)-[:BELONG_TO]->(:PeopleNode)`: Reviews belong to specific people.

# Key Points
## Maintaining Knowledge Tree
- Maintain a tree structure of the knowledge tree.
- Add content to the most leaf tag on the knowledge tree.
- The knowledge tree can only be updated when at least 3 members of the core team reach an agreement.

### Content Types:
1. Project
2. Course
3. Book
4. Mentorship
5. Certificate
6. Self-Summary
7. Achievement
8. Event
9. SharingSession

# How to Add Nodes

All the code to create nodes is stored in the `neo4j_management` folder.

## Adding a Node to the Knowledge Tree

To add a node to the knowledge tree, follow these steps:

1. Open [knowledge_tree_info.json](neo4j_management%2Fknowledge_tree_info.json).
2. Add a new node object to the appropriate location in the JSON structure. Ensure that the node's name is unique within its category. For example:
    ```json
    {
      "name": "fun_node",
      "children": [
        {"name": "philosophy",
         "children": [
           {"name": "stoicism"}
         ]},
        {"name": "popular_science_books"}
      ]
    }
    ```
   In this example, the new node "Popular Science Books" is added under the "Fun" category.
3. Once the JSON file is updated with the new node, run the Python script to update the knowledge tree in Neo4j, as described in the [Usage](#usage) section of the README.

Make sure to update your `knowledge_tree.json` file to reflect any changes or additions to the knowledge tree structure.

## Adding a Content Node

To add a content node, follow these steps:
1. Open [content_node_info.json](neo4j_management%2Fcontent_node_info.json).
2. Add a new content node entry in the JSON file, following this structure:
    ```json
    {
        "relations": ["finetuning", "retrieval_augmented_generation", "python"],
        "properties": {
            "content_uniquev": "logxpert_sbc",
            "name": "LogXpert: efficient log analysis tool for SBC",
            "type": "Project",
            "info": "hahahha</p>"
        }
    }
    ```

   This entry includes all the information and relations to all the nodes it may attach to in the knowledge tree. Note that you can use HTML in the info field. Ensure that `content_uniquev` is unique.

## Adding a Review Node

To add a review node, follow these steps:
1. Open [review_node_info.json](neo4j_management%2Freview_node_info.json).
2. Add a new review node entry in the JSON file, following this structure:
    ```json 
   {
        "content_uniquev": "experpert1_kubernetes",
        "reviewer": "jora",
        "properties": {
            "review_id": "experpert1_kubernetes_review_jora",
            "stars": 5,
            "comments": "The best and most complete basics of kubernetes training.",
            "status": "In Progress"
        }
    }
    ```

   This entry includes all the information and the content node it attaches to. Ensure that `review_id` is unique.



## Running the Program to Add All Nodes

- If you only add nodes without modifying existing ones, run:
    ```bash
    python create_everything.py
    ```

- If you also modify existing nodes or relationships, first, in your Neo4j database, run:
    ```agsl
    MATCH (n)
    DETACH DELETE n;
    ```
    And then, 
    ```bash
    python create_everything.py
    ```
